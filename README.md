Developing Data Products Course Project

===========================================

The assignment consists of two questions:

1. Write a shiny application and provide a public link to it. Provide access to the source code (server.R and ui.R file)

You can find the source code in this github repo (https://github.com/mdpesheva/Developing_Data_Products_Course_Project).

There are two methods of running and viewing the application (MyApp_Height):

a. Download the ui.R and server.R file in your R working directory and run the following commands:
      library(shiny);runApp()

b. Or visit the following link on Shinyapps.io -> https://mdpesheva.shinyapps.io/myapp_height/

2. The second part of the assignment is to provide a presentation with information of the app.
